# TicketChain

TicketChain is an NFT event ticketing system that allows event organizers to create events and customers to purchase tickets, all on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Installation and Dependencies
Download the source code from the [master branch](https://github.com/mgysel/comp6452-nft).

This system requires Python 3.7.2, Node.js 14.17, and Ganche CLI v6.12.2 or higher. You can install dependencies and run the component applications. 
This system also requires the application to be run on a web browser with Metamask installed. Metamask must be connected to Ganache on http://localhost:8545.

The blockchain application can be found in the `root` directory. Navigate into this directory, then run an Ethereum blockchain on Ganche as follows:
```sh
$ ganache-cli -d 100000000 --allowUnlimitedContractSize
```
Next, open a new terminal and deploy the application to Ganache using 
```sh
$ truffle deploy --reset
```

The backend Flask application can be found in the `backend` directory. Navigate into this directory, then set up and run the application as follows:
```sh
$ python3 -m virtualenv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$ python3 server.py
```

The frontend React application can be found in the `root` directory. Navigate into this directory, then set up and run the application as follows:
```sh
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```

Note that the manual set up commands must be run from the respective directories of the blockchain, backend, and frontend applications.
